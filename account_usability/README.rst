* disable reconciliation "guessing"
* fast search on *Reconcile Ref* for account move line.
* add sale dates to invoice report to be compliant with
  https://www.service-public.fr/professionnels-entreprises/vosdroits/F31808
* Sale date on qweb invoices
* A wizard to mark several invoices as sent at once (forward from v8)
* Default date for Account Move Reversal is now D+1 instead of today
* Track more fields on invoice (see details in account.py)
* Add boolean fields `has_discount` and `has_attachment` on invoice
* Add button "Delete line qty = 0" on supplier invoice

Together with this module, I recommend the use of the following modules:

* invoice_fiscal_position_update (OCA project account-invoicing)
