<!-- This group is used to hide menu entries to everybody,
so you should not put any user in this group. It is used
by the module account_hide_analytic_line, but it will certainly
be used by other modules in the future, that's why I declare
this group in the base_usability module
I don't want to use the base.group_no_one for this, because a lot
of interesing menu entries are attached to this group, so it's
common to have several users that belong to this group -->
